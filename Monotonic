# Monotonic ==  A function or system which is either increasing or decreasing

An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

An array nums is monotone increasing if for all i <= j, nums[i] <= nums[j]. An array nums is monotone decreasing if for all i <= j, nums[i] >= nums[j].

Monotonic
nums = [1,2,2,3]
nums = [6,5,4,4]

Not monotonic
nums = [1,3,2]

    --- If O(1) memory required and involves monotonic condition ----> use two pointers
